GoUpdate
========

GoUpdate is a simple update system built to handle automatically updating applications and their components. It is designed to work with MultiMC, but it will probably work decently with other applications as well.

GoUpdate is really just a protocol dictating how the client and update server are to interact with each other, but the "official" client is written in GoLang (thus the name "GoUpdate").
